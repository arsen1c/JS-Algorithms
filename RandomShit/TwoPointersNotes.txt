# Concept Introduction
  - It involves using two pointers to save time and space. (Here, pointers are basically array indexes).
  - The idea here is to iterate two different parts of the array simultaneously to get the answer faster.

# Implementation 
  - There are 2 approach for this
    1. One pointer at each end
    2. Different Paces

1. One pointer at each end
  - One pointer starts from beginning and other from the end and they proceed towards each other
